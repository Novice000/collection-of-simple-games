     description: "A classic game of Tic Tac Toe. Simple yet challenging. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, with two players, X and O. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all of the squares are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw."
